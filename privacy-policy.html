                The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. 
                We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection 
                regulations and this data protection declaration. Our website can usually be used without providing 
                any personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected 
                on our website, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. 
                This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. 
                We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) 
                can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.<br><br>

                The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files,
